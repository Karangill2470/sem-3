    <h1>RPS Game </h1>
    <h2>Introduction:    </h2>
<p>In this project, I designed a simple console-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game using C#. <br>
    The game allows users to play against a computer opponent in the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors <br>
    challenge. The program employs fundamental concepts of C# programming, including user input,<br> conditional statements,
     loops, and random number generation.</p>

     <h2>Features:</h2>
     <h3>1.User Interaction:</h3>
<p>
        The program begins by prompting the user to choose between "ROCK," "PAPER," or "SCISSORS."
        User input is case-insensitive and validated to ensure a valid choice is made.</p>
        <h3>2.Computer Choice:</h3>
        <p>The computer's choice is randomly generated using the Random class in C#. It can select "ROCK," "PAPER," or "SCISSORS."</p>

        
        <h3>3.Determining the Winner:</h3>
        <p>The game logic determines the winner based on the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors rules.
            If the user and computer choices are the same, the game results in a tie.
            Win-lose scenarios are determined using conditional statements.</p>

        <h3>4.Play Again:</h3>
        <p>After each round, the user is given the option to play again.
            The game continues until the user decides not to play anymore..</p>

        <h2>Code Structure:</h2>

            Certainly! Here's a written explanation that you can include in your portfolio to describe the Rock, Paper, Scissors game:

            Introduction:

The program employs fundamental concepts of C# programming, including user input, conditional statements, loops, and random number generation.
            
            Features:
            
            User Interaction:
            
            The program begins by prompting the user to choose between "ROCK," "PAPER," or "SCISSORS."

            Play Again:
            
            After each round, the user is given the option to play again.
            The game continues until the user decides not to play anymore.
            Code Structure:
            
            The program follows a structured C# code with a Main method as the entry point.
            A while loop is used to allow the user to play multiple rounds until they decide to stop.
            Methods like GetComputerChoice and DetermineWinner are employed for code modularity and readability.</p>
